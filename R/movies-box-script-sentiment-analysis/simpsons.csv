Miss Hoover,"No, actually, it was a little of both. Sometimes when a disease is in all the magazines and all the news shows, it's only natural that you think you have it."
Lisa Simpson,Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
Miss Hoover,I don't know. Although I'd sure like to talk to him. He didn't touch my lesson plan. What did he teach you?
Lisa Simpson,That life is worth living.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"The polls will be open from now until the end of recess. Now, just in case any of you have decided to put any thought into this, we'll have our final statements. Martin?"
Martin Prince,I don't think there's anything left to say.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,Bart?
Bart Simpson,Victory party under the slide!
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Bergstrom! Mr. Bergstrom!
Landlady,"Hey, hey, he Moved out this morning. He must have a new job -- he took his Copernicus costume."
Lisa Simpson,Do you know where I could find him?
Landlady,I think he's taking the next train to Capital City.
Lisa Simpson,"The train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound."
Landlady,"Yes, and it's been the backbone of our country since Leland Stanford drove that golden spike at Promontory point."
Lisa Simpson,"I see he touched you, too."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, thanks for your vote, man."
Nelson Muntz,I didn't vote. Voting's for geeks.
Bart Simpson,"Well, you got that right. Thanks for your vote, girls."
Terri/sherri,We forgot.
Bart Simpson,"Well, don't sweat it. Just so long as a couple of people did... right, Milhouse?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Uh oh.
Bart Simpson,Lewis?
Bart Simpson,Somebody must have voted.
Milhouse Van Houten,"What about you, Bart? Didn't you vote?"
Bart Simpson,Uh oh.
Wendell Borton,Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
Bart Simpson,I demand a recount.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"One for Martin, two for Martin. Would you like another recount?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders,"Well, I just want to make sure. One for Martin. Two for Martin."
Kid Reporter,"This way, Mister President!"
Conductor,"Now boarding on track 5, The afternoon delight coming to Shelbyville, Parkville, andâ€¦.."
Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, Mr. Bergstrom!"
BERGSTROM,"Hey, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Lisa, indeed."
BERGSTROM,What? What is it?
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?"
BERGSTROM,"Ah, I'm sorry, Lisa. You know, it's the life of the substitute teacher: he's a fraud. Today he might be wearing gym shorts, tomorrow he's speaking French, or, or, or pretending to know how to run a band saw, or God knows what."
Lisa Simpson,You can't go! You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
BERGSTROM,"Ah, that's not true. Other teachers will come along who..."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, please."
BERGSTROM,"No, I can't lie to you, I am the best. But, you know, they need me over in the projects of Capital City."
Lisa Simpson,But I need you too.
BERGSTROM,That's the problem with being middle class. Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more.
Lisa Simpson,"I, I understand. Mr. Bergstrom, I'm going to miss you."
BERGSTROM,I'll tell you what...
BERGSTROM,"Whenever you feel like you're alone and there's nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know."
Lisa Simpson,"Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom."
Conductor,All aboard!
